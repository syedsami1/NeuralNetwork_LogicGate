# Neural Network Implementation for Logic Gate or MNIST Dataset with Visualization

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of a neural network for either a logic gate or the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. It includes visualizations to provide insights into the model's behavior and performance.

### Main Components

1. **Neural Network Implementation**: Utilizes PyTorch to construct a neural network model tailored for either logic gate operations or handwritten digit recognition.
   
2. **Data Preparation**: Handles dataset preparation, ensuring seamless compatibility with the neural network model through proper transformation and organization.
   
3. **Training the Model**: Trains the neural network model with appropriate optimization and loss functions to achieve optimal performance.
   
4. **Visualizations**: Integrates various visualizations, including model architecture diagrams, training progress charts, and sample model predictions, to aid in understanding the model's behavior and accuracy.

5. **Gradio Interface (Optional)**: If desired, Gradio is utilized to create an interactive web-based interface for real-time digit classification or logic gate operations.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Ensure all required libraries and dependencies, including Python 3, PyTorch, and Gradio (if applicable), are installed and up-to-date.

2. **Running the Code**: Follow the instructions in the main script to train the model and visualize the results for both logic gate and MNIST dataset use cases.

3. **Visualizations**: Access the provided visualizations to gain insights into the model architecture, training progress, and sample predictions. These visualizations aid in understanding the model's behavior, accuracy, and training process.

4. **Gradio Interface**: If using Gradio for interactive interfaces, launch and interact with the web-based interface to analyze the model's predictions in real-time.
